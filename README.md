# STAT184-HW-Template
STAT184 group 10 project
## Introduction
This repository is part of the STAT184 project, focusing on data analysis and visualization. The project analyzes trends in a dataset to identify patterns and produce meaningful insights.
## Implementation
The analysis was conducted using **R programming**. The key steps include:  
1. Data Preprocessing:  
   - Cleaned and transformed the data using `dplyr`.  
   - Addressed missing data using imputation techniques.  

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):  
   - Visualized distributions of variables using `ggplot2`.  
   - Generated correlation heatmaps to identify significant predictors.  

3. Predictive Modeling:  
   - Developed a **logistic regression model** to predict diabetes outcomes.  
   - Evaluated model performance using metrics: **accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity**.  

4. Challenges:  
   - Missing values in key variables (Insulin and Skin Thickness).  
   - Addressed these challenges using appropriate statistical techniques.
## Results/Conclusion
Glucose levels, BMI, and diabetes pedigree scores are the most significant predictors of diabetes, older individuals and those with higher BMI are at increased risk.  
This analysis highlights the importance of glucose levels and BMI in diabetes prediction. Future work can improve model accuracy by incorporating additional features such as diet and exercise.
